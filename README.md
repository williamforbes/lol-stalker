## Purpose

I have kids who play Leagoe of Legends.  They are great kids, but they spend too much time there.  I play with them some times too, but I am terrible at it and they get mad.  I wanted some simple data to see how much they are playing just as an interesting now.
tl;dr Lets you see how much time user spend in the game.

## Steps

1. You will need to create a LoL id.  You can do this by going here:  http://na.leagueoflegends.com/. 
2. Sign up for an API key.  You can do that here:  https://developer.riotgames.com/
3. Get the name of the player you want to check.  Name is called "summoner name"
